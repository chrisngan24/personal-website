      <p>Play On Time is a metronome application that has been developed for Sony Smartwatch.  Rather than acting as a traditional metronome that uses sound to provide a steady tempo, it uses the vibrator within the device to generate timed pulses.  It comes with a simple interface that allows the user to control the tempo.</p>
